# SoSearch API

A lightning-fast pseudo Web Search Engine API written in **Rust** (RIIR - Rewrite It In Rust style).
This project emulates popular APIs like *SerpAPI* or *Tavily* without needing official and expensive API keys, by multiplexing requests to popular engines directly and scraping the results concurrently.

## Philosophy

- **Performance**: Powered by `tokio` for async concurrent I/O.
- **Bot Bypass**: Leverages `rquest` with TLS impersonation (e.g., simulating a Chrome 124 browser footprint at the TLS/HTTP2 layer) to minimize blocking vs standard HTTP clients (the Rust equivalent of `curl_cffi`).
- **Standardized**: Normalizes `DuckDuckGo`, `Yahoo`, and `Brave` HTML results into a standardized `SearchResult` JSON array.

## Core Stack
- [Axum](https://github.com/tokio-rs/axum)
- [Tokio](https://tokio.rs/)
- [rquest](https://github.com/0x676e67/rquest)
- [scraper](https://github.com/causal-agent/scraper)

## 🔍 Supported Search Engines

*   **DuckDuckGo** (Primary standard search)
*   **Yahoo** (Powered by Bing)
*   **Brave Search** (Independent index)

## 🤖 Agent Skills & MCP Support

This project includes built-in AI agent support for both **Gemini CLI** and other tools that follow the `.agents/` convention.

### Available Skills

| Skill | Description |
|---|---|
| `sosearch-engine-dev` | Full workflow for adding/debugging search engine scrapers: fetch HTML → test selectors offline → decode URLs → integrate |
| `sosearch-api-ops` | Operations guide: build, run, test, deploy (local + Docker), troubleshoot |

### MCP Servers

Configured in `.gemini/settings.json`:

| Server | Package | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `filesystem` | `@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem` | Scoped file access to project directory |

### Usage with Gemini CLI

```bash
cd /path/to/SoSearch
gemini
# Skills are auto-discovered. Ask: "How do I add a new search engine?"
```

## 🚀 Quick Start
